## About

The Ionic Theme Editor is a simple live-editor for the [Ionic Framework](ionicframework.com). You can visually customize the primary Ionic variables, view your live changes immediately in several previews, and download a compiled css file with your edits.

## Contributing

Currently the Ionic Theme Editor is hosted in a heroku app. All changes inbetween each release are made to the github repo. I use grunt to build the files. To get setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/pbernasconi/ionic-theme-editor.git
cd ionic-theme-editor
npm install
bower install
grunt build
grunt serve
```

Make a new Pull Request for any changes you think are necessary!
